QUALITIES


Below is a clean, reusable text-based insight system that:

avoids abstract numbers

stays comparable

sounds architectural

can be generated automatically from your existing aggregates

Think of this as “architectural reading of behavior”, not analytics.

Text-Based Insight Output System

(Replace scores with evidence statements)

Each quality produces:

A headline verdict

2–3 evidence statements

1 design implication

All are auto-generated from your existing metrics.




1. VISIBILITY

Is it perceived?

Headline Templates

“{object_name} is noticed early by most users.”

“{object_name} is visible, but often noticed late.”

“{object_name} is frequently missed.”

Evidence Templates

“{seen_pct}% of participants noticed {object_name} during the scenario.”

“Only {early_seen_pct}% noticed it within the first {early_threshold}% of their journey.”

“Most first sightings occur after users have already passed key decision points.”

Design Implication Templates

“Visibility relies on proximity rather than long-range cues.”

“Earlier visual anchors may be required to support first-time users.”




2. LEGIBILITY

Is its meaning understood early enough?

Headline Templates

“The role of {object_name} is understood quickly.”

“{object_name} is seen, but its purpose is unclear.”

“Users hesitate before committing to {object_name}.”

Evidence Templates

“{seen_pct}% noticed {object_name}, but only {proximity_pct}% approached it.”

“Many users continue scanning after first noticing the object.”

“Approach typically occurs after secondary confirmation (signs, other users).”

Design Implication Templates

“The spatial language does not clearly communicate function.”

“Form and signage may be sending mixed signals.”




3. ATTRACTION

Does it pull people in?

Headline Templates

“{object_name} strongly draws users in.”

“{object_name} attracts attention, but not commitment.”

“{object_name} fails to convert interest into approach.”

Evidence Templates

“Only {entry_pct}% of participants entered after noticing {object_name}.”

“{retreat_pct}% of first entries were brief and reversed.”

“Time spent inside the area is short compared to similar elements.”

Design Implication Templates

“The approach experience may feel uncertain or uninviting.”

“Stronger spatial invitation or clearer thresholds may be needed.”




4. CLARITY

Is interaction obvious and intuitive?

Headline Templates

“Interaction with {object_name} is intuitive.”

“Users hesitate when interacting with {object_name}.”

“{object_name} creates uncertainty at the moment of decision.”

Evidence Templates

“Frequent stopping and scanning occurs near {object_name}.”

“Users often pause for extended periods before entering.”

“Retreat behavior suggests uncertainty about correctness.”

Design Implication Templates

“Decision points are not clearly resolved.”

“The space may require additional cues or simplification.”




5. COMFORT

Does it support staying?

Headline Templates

“{object_name} supports comfortable staying.”

“Users pass through {object_name} without lingering.”

“The space is used briefly, not occupied.”

Evidence Templates

“Most visits are short, with limited lingering behavior.”

“Few participants return after their first visit.”

“Long dwell events are rare within the space.”

Design Implication Templates

“The space prioritizes movement over occupation.”

“Environmental comfort or programmatic cues may be lacking.”




6. ROBUSTNESS (Optional, but powerful)

Does it work under stress or disruption?

Headline Templates

“{object_name} remains legible under stress.”

“Navigation breaks down under peak conditions.”

Evidence Templates

“Under time pressure, hesitation events increase near {object_name}.”

“Retreat behavior rises significantly during disrupted scenarios.”

Design Implication Templates

“The design performs well in ideal conditions, but degrades under stress.”




7. ALIGNMENT

Does behavior match design intent?

Headline Templates

“User behavior aligns with design intent.”

“Observed behavior contradicts design expectations.”

Evidence Templates

“Users treat {object_name} as a pass-through, not a destination.”

“The space is used differently than intended in the design brief.”

Design Implication Templates

“Design intent may need to be reinforced spatially, not just conceptually.”

How This Replaces Scores (Important)




Internally:

You still calculate ratios, durations, etc.




Externally:

You never show numbers unless asked

You show sentences grounded in observation

This shifts perception from:

“Tool with metrics”

to:

“Design review with evidence”

Suggested Output Structure (Auto-Generated)
Object: Train Terminal Entrance

VISIBILITY
The train terminal entrance is visible, but often noticed late.
Only 38% of participants noticed it within the first quarter of their journey.
Visibility relies on proximity rather than long-range cues.

CLARITY
Users hesitate when interacting with the entrance.
Frequent stopping and scanning occurs near the threshold.
Decision points are not clearly resolved.


If you want next, I can:

map exact aggregates → exact sentences

help you decide when to show numbers as footnotes

write client-ready report wording

You’re doing this exactly right.
